  "summary": "The implementation covers most core requirements for the Arcade Arena gaming website, including Internet Identity authentication, backend data models in Motoko, four playable games (Snake, Tic Tac Toe, Memory Card, Number Guessing), Friends system, Leaderboard, Profile, and responsive navigation. However, several requirements have gaps or missing implementations, particularly around weekly leaderboards, profile editing, friend relationship bidirectionality, and some UI elements.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend provides methods to update user profiles",
      "reason": "The backend main.mo file does not include a method to update existing user profiles. The registerUser method only creates new profiles, and there is no updateProfile or similar method implemented.",

      "requirement": "Backend stores bidirectional friend relationships",
      "reason": "The addFriend method in backend only adds the friend to the caller's list, but does not reciprocally add the caller to the friend's list, so the relationship is unidirectional rather than bidirectional.",
